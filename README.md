# Joust!

Flatiron Module 4 project by German Garcia Gonzales and Pete Hanner

## FRONT END

Developed as part of curriculum at Flatiron DC. Paired project focusing on React framework. In this game, users select their armor, weapon, and horse to take part in a medieval tournament. Each loadout option has differing stats in attack, defense, and speed. These stats are tied to a randomized "battle" algorithm, resulting in unique benefits and drawbacks for each different loadout. Will users try to make a balanced build that mitigates any weak points but doesn't excel in any particular area? Or will they go the min-max route to become an untouchable tortoise, wiley speed demon, or damage-heavy berserker?

## Demo

When the game loads, the right side icons are blank, indicating that the user still needs to select their loadout.

Clicking on one of the left-side icons takes you to the loadout screen. Clicking any of the items in the grid will show you a card with details on its battle stats. Once the desired equipment has been found, click the 'equip' button to add it to your loadout.
